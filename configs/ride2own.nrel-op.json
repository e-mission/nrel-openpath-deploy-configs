To gather the data needed, this pilot requires an automated trip tracking solution for understanding travel behavior. The pilot will allow TST to understand variations in travel across days of the week and months of the year without complex, time-consuming surveys.",
                "why_we_collect": "The data collected during the program will be used to understand how eBikes are used, including when and how often as well as distance traveled. TST can use this information to understand how people are using eBikes, what their constraints are, and will help policymakers and decisionmakers in Oregon understand how to better provide bike infrastructure to the area. This comprehensive information will aid TST in its mission to help build a complete, safe, low-carbon, multimodal transportation system that contributes to equity in access, opportunity, health, and prosperity for people and communities across the Portland Metro Region and beyond.",
