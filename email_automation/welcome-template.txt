        The login to the admin dashboard uses 2-factor authentication. You will have to install an authenticator app (e.g. Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator) to receive One Time Passcodes (OTP) every time you want to log in. This is a requirement from NREL cyber to ensure that the data access to individual user information is secure.<br>
      <br>
    For the specified date range, you can download trip, user and trajectory tables as csv and view aggregate origin-destination points in the maps. <map_trip_lines> <br>
